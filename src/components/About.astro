    <p><span>Hi, I'm Garrett Siegel</span>, a creative front-end developer and designer dedicated to creating interactive and responsive user experiences. My expertise lies in the core web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is supplemented by extensive experience with platforms and frameworks such as React, Astro, Hugo, and recently Svelte.</p>
    
    <p>I am committed to excellence in codebase improvement, with a focus on modularity, componentization, and customizability. Lately, my efforts have concentrated on enhancing site performance optimizations and accessibility, alongside employing data metrics to monitor and improve user interactions. My passion for data visualization has led me to explore D3.js, aiming to create interactive, engaging, and accessible user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Beyond development, my background as a professional visual designer spans almost a decade, encompassing a wide range of skills in graphic design, web design, animation, motion design, and 3D modeling. Proficient in the Adobe Creative Suite, Autodesk Maya, Blender, and Figma, I ensure that my designs are not only visually appealing but also seamlessly responsive across various platforms.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I have become a trusted contributor to renowned organizations, including ESPN, Microsoft, K&N Engineering, Kroger, and RTIC, among others. As a lifelong learner, I continuously engage with the latest technology and design trends to keep my work innovative and relevant.</p>

    <p>My portfolio is a demonstration of my dedication to blending aesthetically pleasing design with functional digital experiences. I invite you to explore my work and reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project.</p>
